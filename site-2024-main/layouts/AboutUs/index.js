				Welcome to Engineering Open House and the University of Illinois! We are extremely happy to welcome all
				of our visitors, field trips, community members, students and faculty to the 101st in-person EOH! For
				the past 100+ years EOH has drawn hundreds of thousands of visitors to the University of Illinois and
				provided a unique outlet for visitors to explore engineering. As we rebound from the pandemic, we want
				to highlight the tremendous speed at which the Grainger College of Engineering and the field in general
				is evolving with our theme, <span className="font-bold">The Future, Today</span>.
				<br />
				<br />
				To our visitors we hope that EOH provides an outlet for everyone to explore engineering and STEM related
				fields. This year we welcome 200+ exhibits to EOH ranging from drone demonstrations to prosthetic hands
				and a wind tunnel demo. We believe that every exhibit at EOH has the ability to make an impact on our
				visitors and highlight the prestige of the Grainger College of Engineering and our students. We hope
				that by exploring our student exhibits, special events and corporate talks, EOH will help to inspire
				future generations to become involved in engineering and reimagine{' '}

				<br />
				<br />
				We would like to take a moment to thank all of our student-led exhibits, volunteers, campus partners,
				faculty and Grainger administration. EOH would not be what is today without your help, imagination,
				resilience and dedication to making engineering accessible to all. Additionally, Engineering Open House
				would not be possible without the 26 Directors on our Central Committee. Being a completely student-run
				event we rely on the work of our Directors to execute and plan each event all while balancing academics,
				jobs and other extracurriculars; the time they have dedicated to EOH is immeasurable and will forever be
				remembered in this yearâ€™s EOH. As a final note, we thank all of our visitors for attending EOH and we
				hope that you will be able to get a glimpse into what engineering will look like in{' '}
				<span className="font-bold">The Future, Today</span>.

				<br />
				Happy Exploring and Safe Travels!
