        "descriptionShort": "HIV remains one of the biggest health challenges around the world. As the virus that causes AIDS and other complications, it affects more than 37 million people worldwide. Though there is no effective cure, a variety of therapies have been developed to help prolong the life of people living with HIV. Despite significant progress in HIV cure research, therapy effectiveness may be halted by unknown regulatory interactions taking place between HIV and its host cell. How can we further understand the mystics of HIV behaviors and mechanisms to reach closer to possible cures?",
        "descriptionLong": "This exhibit presents a recently published paper by Alexandra Blanco of the Dar research group. The paper investigates the latent nature of HIV and how we can develop future therapies. Abstract: Upon infection of its host cell, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) establishes a quiescent and non-productive state capable of spontaneous reactivation. Diverse cell types harboring the provirus form a latent reservoir, constituting a major obstacle to curing HIV. Here, we investigate the effects of latency reversal agents (LRAs) in an HIV-infected THP-1 monocyte cell line in vitro. We demonstrate that leading drug treatments synergize activation of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. We establish a latency model in THP-1 monocytes using a replication incompetent HIV reporter vector with functional Tat, and show that chromatin modifiers synergize with a potent transcriptional activator to enhance HIV reactivation, similar to T-cells. Furthermore, leading reactivation cocktails are shown to differentially affect latency reactivation and surface expression of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), leading to altered host cell migration. This study investigates the effect of chromatin-modifying LRA treatments on HIV latent reactivation and cell migration in monocytes. As previously reported in T-cells, epigenetic mechanisms in monocytes contribute to controlling the relationship between latent reactivation and cell migration. Ultimately, advanced \u201cShock and Kill\u201d therapy needs to successfully target and account for all host cell types represented in a complex and composite latency milieu.",

Visitors can touch and play with these materials which are safe to touch, using their hands to feel the differences, and are in fact encouraged to interact with our live demos to get a better understanding of flow phenomena around us in all the common materials that we live with. We also need a screen to show the research projects and collaborations in our group, which can be used in many applications such as fire suppression and 3D printing. We will also use the screen to show the interdisciplinary research in our group: our collaborators include chemists, materialists, biologists, and so on; together we can understand the fundamentals and applications of the complex fluids and this is the power of us.",

        "descriptionLong": "The goal of this project is to use nail art/polish as a hands-on demonstration to explain 3D biofabrication (as taught in BIOE476). As gel nail polish and dip powder nail kits have the same photopolymerization and layer-by-layer technique to create strong nails, this parallel can be used to demonstrate 3D biofabrication techniques used in tissue engineering such as stereolithography and 3D printing. We would find a way to also do 3D printing to show the parallels between the techniques.The exhibit would be composed of two components at a table: hands-on portion and poster portion. The hands-on section will have nail art techniques for people to have the chance to try out the techniques. People would be using a nail swatch to try out the dip powder and UV/LED gel nail kits while members of our EOH team explain how these techniques are similar. Then, the EOH team members would also show how this is related to a 3D printing demonstration with a 3D pen as well. For the poster portion, there would be a poster behind the hands on portion that would explain the makeup of the nail art as well as the background and methods to 3D biofabrication. Also, a video demonstration can also be done if necessary due to the COVID19 situation. I hope that this exhibit would allow for others to better understand this tissue engineering method, and for those who are younger to be inspired to pursue bioengineering.",

If we are unable to get support rings, we will modify the procedure so that they are not required. We will also need a small kitchen scale.Procedure: Two stock solutions will be prepared. For the first stock solution, a beaker placed on the table will be filled with 100 mL water. We will add 0.18 g of luminol and 3.0 mL sodium hydroxide (1M) solution. For safety, NaOH will be kept away from heat and gloves and goggles will be worn. Grade school students will be kept 6-10 feet away from the chemicals to avoid exposure. A second stock solution will be prepared by adding 1mL of hydrogen peroxide (3%) and 0.03g ferricyanide. This will be done with gloves and guests will be asked to keep a distance. Goggles will be supplied by us, but we will need pipettes. An apparatus will be setup using a funnel attached to tubing held by clamps under a collection flask (preferably Erlenmeyer) in the center of the table. The lights will then be dimmed, and the solutions will be simultaneously poured down the secured tubing. The apparatus will be setup beforehand and cleaned in between uses with DI water in a sink exclusively for chemistry labs periodically. A blue light will be seen for guests to enjoy. The primary safety concern is with NaOH, hydrogen peroxide, and Potassium ferricyanide. If we could get a fume hood that would be great, but if not, we can make sure guests stay a good distance (6-10 ft) away from the chemicals. Glow sticks will be distributed for grade school students to snap, and there are no safety concerns for the glow sticks. We will follow CDC Covid guidelines on mask wearing and social distancing. The budget is around 84.5 dollars. (NOTE: If NaOH is too unsafe to use, we can remove it).",

Finally, our machine has a collection bay for waste fluid and it would be optimal if we were placed within walking distance of a drain or dumping location (e.g. bushes, fluid is non-toxic).Regarding safety, our primary concerns are electrical shorts, contamination, allergies, and surface stability.- Electrically, in the off chance fluid leaks into contact with the sealed electronics, we will place adequate fuses on all of our circuits. Our main DC power supply has over-current protection as well and will shut off before causing damage.- Food contamination will be mitigated through proper material selection and sanitation. All materials in contact with drink fluid have the sufficient FDA approvals, chemical/thermal compatibilities, and are sourced from reputable American vendors. We have a cleaning protocol in place as well during setup and teardown.- Exhibit-goers will be made aware of potential allergen contact before they order.

Since each wheel is attached to a motor, this project will apply mechanical concepts of gear ratios and rotation (it will be important to know how to make the robot move or rotate in a certain direction, since omnidirectional wheels operate differently than standard wheels).In terms of the layout, the project consists of a partially unrolled roll of butcher paper surrounded on two sides by short wooden walls (used by the robot to determine its position). On a nearby table is a laptop (ideally connected to a power outlet) that is set up to send input to the robot.

But if you have puddles of water in your tray, that\u2019s too much, and it may grow mold. The dampness is what\u2019s going to trigger the seeds to start sprouting, or germinate. The reason they don\u2019t sprout in the seed packet is because they\u2019re all dry. Once you add water, they know it\u2019s time to start growing.Now, I\u2019m going to leave it on a sunny windowsill for a couple days. It\u2019ll look like this after a day or two, then this, and after about a week it\u2019ll look like this! And your microgreens are ready to harvest.

Tornado in a Bottle Demo: We plan to have a 2-liter bottle attached to two ends and filled with water that can be spun around to create a little tornado in a bottle. This will serve as a fun demo that the audience may try on their own as well as being informative as we will explain the basic concepts behind a tornado (ex: which way is it spinning, how to make it spin faster, etc),3. Doppler on Wheels (DOW) Truck Demo: If they are available, we plan on having the Doppler on Wheels Truck come to EOH and it will be available for everyone to see. We will explain how the DOW works and the different instruments inside of it. NOTE: This demo is contingent on whether or not the DOWs will be available, as they are being used for a research project during this time that is weather-dependent. If the DOW is unavailable, we have videos of them that we can use to show students how it works. If the DOW is available, we would like to get in touch with the EOH planning team to see if we can have a location for our exhibit, where we can park the DOW next to the booth to have people look at it., 4. Thunderstorm Diorama Demo: (If available) We plan on having a Thunderstorm Diorama where students can assemble the basic parts of a thunderstorm. From there we will explain why various parts go where and help students build it so that it can be both fun and educational. NOTE: If this demo is not available, we also may have access to a \u201cWater Budget\u201d model where it shows different areas that water is transported and stored in the atmosphere as a back up.5. Crushing Can Demo: We plan on doing a demo where we heat a can over a hot plate and then put it in a bowl of ice water and students can see how the pressure inside of the can increases and/or decreases due to the temperature changes. As a result the can will be \u201ccrushed\u201d as it enters the ice water. NOTE: We will need access to electricity for this demo in order to make it work!6. Cloud Identification & Matching Demo: We plan on having a demo where students can match different types of clouds together on a poster and we will explain how various types of clouds form and where they form.

The safety concerns associated with this project is that one is producing hydrogen and oxygen gas, given that it is in small amounts, but is still flammable enough to combust if exposed to a flame or spark. Therefore, if this gas were to be contained and stored in a test tube or container, one should be aware of these hazards.

This Auto Sorting Trash Bin has various types of sensors that would detect the waste materials entering the bin. Smart trash bin is made to separate the waste into 4 categories: glass, plastic, paper, and can. The trash bin is composed of two parts: sensing, mechanical. The sensing part utilizes various sensors (Ultrasonic, Inductive, LDR) to distinguish the chemical and physical characteristics of the waste. With the backbone of the trash barrel, the machine learning algorithm provides data allowing how each waste should be distributed to each relevant section. According to the EPA, only 30% of wastes were recycled even though 75% of wastes were recyclable. By recycling the wastes, we can conserve energy and reduce landfill use. It would save up to 95% energy to recycle aluminum compared to making the material out of raw materials which would eventually lead to reduction of greenhouse gasses and toxic chemicals.",

        "descriptionShort": "This outdoor demo simulates the volcano eruption. It operates on physics similar to which drives volcanic eruptions, and it provides ways for students to visualize eruptive processes and apply basic physical principles. The demonstration is on a scale accessible to students, using trash can, soda bottles, liquid nitrogen etc.",
        "descriptionLong": "This is an outdoor demo showing a volcanic eruption using a trash can. It is an analog model of eruptive processes for students to visualize eruptive processes and apply basic physical principles when field observations are not feasible. It demonstrates volcanic eruptions are fundamentally gas-driven phenomena and explosive volcanic eruptions occurred when gases in magma expand and come out of solution and thus pressure is beyond the strength of the surrounding rock (depressurization of volatiles dissolved in magma during ascent).I will demonstrate this dramatic but safe explosion and eruptive column of gas-driven eruption by filling the weighted, plastic soda bottle with liquid nitrogen and sinking the capped bottle into the trash can about half full of water. As the liquid nitrogen warm up into a gas and expand its volume, it will explode from the soda bottle and cause the eruption. During its explosion, the expansive force propels a column of water vertically, to 10 or more meters. The pressure necessary to cause an explosion comes from nitrogen boiling, as liquid nitrogen is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature.The materials used in this demo include industrial strength plastic garbage can, soda bottles (16-20 ounce size is most convenient) with their caps, duct tape, 2 bricks or a large cinder block (must prevent the soda bottle from floating), hose from faucet to site of detonation (a full trashcan is difficult to move to a new location), 2 safety glasses for all participants, insulated gloves for liquid nitrogen protection (two pair per demonstration set-up), Liquid nitrogen (~20 mL per explosion) in a Dewar, and funnel for pouring the nitrogen. The exhibitor will wear closed-toe shoes, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts.",

        "descriptionLong": "At the Autonomous and Unmanned Vehicle Systems Lab, we work on a diverse set of platforms ranging from On-Road to Off-Road vehicles along with Autonomous Aerial and Underwater Systems. For the exhibit, we plan to present 4-5 different types of drones, 30 lb bots, and a static display of large vehicles like the Jackal (reference link: https://clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/), R-Gator (refer: https://www.utvguide.net/john-deere-r-gator/), J5/J8 XTR (https://www.army-technology.com/projects/j8-atlas-xtreme-terrain-robot-xtr/), and possibly Autobon AI\u2019s Peterbilt 587 (semi-tractor). All the large vehicles will be static to avoid any safety issues. Additionally, we will display a simulation of our underwater vehicle and a video demonstration of our ball bot to explain some key features and operations of the mentioned systems. The drones can also be operated to showcase how data is collected and processed for machine learning applications.Since our exhibit requires a lot of space, we are thinking of using the open gravel area behind the Transportation Building Building (It\u2019s on the north east side, by the sidewalk near the methane tank). Usually, this area is sometimes used for large maintenance vehicles. There\u2019s also an open parking lot to the left of the Transportation Building Building where a vehicle could be parked to accommodate any space issues that may occur. If a large open space isn't available, we can select the smaller/compact vehicles and systems for the exhibit to meet the available space requirements.We would like to use the EOH to demonstrate the diverse breadth of work done at the lab and reach out to students interested in becoming involved with the field. More information about our platforms and projects can be found on our lab website linked below in this form.",

        "descriptionLong": "Our exhibit consists of crowd volunteers breaking different materials in order to demonstrate the many different properties of common materials. After a volunteer safely breaks one of the materials provided, we, that being myself and my five classmates, would ask them to describe how it felt to break in different ways such as how hard it was to break, how much it bent or didn\u2019t, and whether the material broke smoothly or jaggedly. After receiving their answers, we would begin to explain each and every one of the things they noticed in terms of materials science, with the help of graphs, graphics, and charts of course. For example, let\u2019s say we had several volunteers. We would give one of them a piece of chalk, one of them a plastic knife, and one of them a paper clip. Then, we would ask them to test their objects without breaking them by trying to bend them, feeling the outside, and just looking at them. They would then describe what they noticed about each one of their items. After following proper safety precautions by giving them eye protection and gloves, and possibly asking them to break it in a plastic box so no pieces go flying, we would ask one them to snap the chalk. Next, we would have the other volunteers snap the plastic knife with their hands, and bend the paperclip until it breaks. Again, we would ask them to describe what they noticed about how each of the objects broke. It would then be our turn to explain to them using knowledge of material science why the objects broke the way they did, with the help stress strain curves, and then teach them how these properties and techniques are applied in real world situations. A second activity would be using a hole punch to put dents in a thing piece of copper, and then explain to the audience about hardness testing. We will not need a ton of space for this exhibit. Probably just a couple tables. Besides tables, chairs, and a trash can, we should be able to provide all of the needed equipment, although it might be nice to borrow a few pairs of safety gloves and glasses if they are available. We will not have any chemicals, and the materials we want our volunteers to break are relatively low risk, so with use of proper safety equipment, it should go smoothly with almost no risk of injury.",

The car\u2019s motion is powered solely by a propeller (i.e., no motor or other power source) and can move faster than the wind turning the propeller, which shouldn\u2019t be possible due to conservation of energy. The fundamental reason for this result is the propeller being attached to one of the wheel axles, such that once the car is moving, the wheels\u2019 rotation causes the propeller speed to increase, creating a thrust force. The actual exhibit, and likely the car that we will build, is based on a video made by an engineering YouTuber named Xyla Foxlin, who designed a car and used a treadmill to replicate the result. This setup changes the frame of reference from the car moving initially due to the wind to moving the ground instead, eliminating any uncontrollable variables like wind speed and helping to limit the space required for the exhibit. Essentially, if our car is calibrated correctly, the car should move forward, opposing the motion of the treadmill belt. The car we will be building is about 21 inches long and includes a propeller, whose shaft is connected to a pair of bevel gears on the front axle. We will also be building our own treadmill, with a planned length of about 33 inches and a width of 24 inches. The exhibit will cover physics and engineering concepts such as conservation of energy, thrust forces, propeller pitch, and gear ratio.",

        "descriptionLong": "WIA is offering 2 different activities: Rockets and Hovercraft. The rocket activity will have 2 versions depending on the age/interest of the visitor.Our booth requires a decent amount of space both vertically and horizontally. Ideal placement for our booth would be outside but can also be adapted to an indoor space with decent ceiling height.Rocket for older visitors: They will construct their own paper rocket using copy paper. Once complete they will put their rocket on the launching apparatus. The launching apparatus consists of a foot stomper air compressor, which is attached to a PVC pipe that will be approximately 5 feet in length. At the end of that PVC pipe is a 45 degree joint which is attached to another PVC pipe that is about 2 feet long. The rocket will go on the end of the 2 foot long section and the visitor will step on the foot air compressor to launch their rocket. We would like to have 2 separate launch apparatuses so 2 visitors can go at a time and \"race\" their rockets next to each other. After visitors have launched their rockets, we will have a measuring string that can be used to tell how far their rocket went. If they want, they could go back and make modifications to their rocket to see if they could get it to launch farther the next time. We'll have a white board and can keep track of the farthest flying rockets. It's expected that the rockets could fly 10-15 feet away from the launching apparatus.Rocket for younger visitors: Since constructing and launching a rocket could be difficult for younger visitors, we want to have an alka-seltzer canister rocket launching station set up too. Young visitors can drop the alka seltzer tablet into a film canister with water. WIA EOH volunteers will then cap the canister and flip it over while the visitor steps back and waits for their film canister rocket to take flight. The film canisters can fly a pretty good distance, probably close to 15 feet.Hovercraft: If visitors don't want to do the rocket activity, or maybe prefer a quicker activity, we will have hovercraft that they can construct. We will do part of the hovercraft assembly ahead of time, so visitors just have to blow up a balloon (with balloon pumps) and connect the PVC pipes together. WIA EOH volunteers can also help blow up the balloons if needed. We would have a piece of white board MDF set up with a course drawn on it where visitors can test out their hovercraft by navigating or racing through the course.",

Our system combines the benefit of the dexterity of a variable length soft manipulator and the rigid support capability of a hard arm. The hard arm positions the extendable soft manipulator close to the target, and the soft arm manipulator navigates the last few centimeters to reach and grab the target. A novel magnetic sensor and reinforcement learning based control is developed for end effector position control of the robot.We will limit our demo to detection of berries on a plant (fake one) using an onboard Intel RealSense camera. The perception algorithm deploys Fast R-CNN to detect the ripe berries and the depth information to obtain the position information of the berries ready to be picked. The spatial information is then used to move the hybrid arm to the location of the berries. The robotic arm also has the capability to deploy its extrudable soft arm to go inside a plant and reach the berries that are difficult to reach with the rigid robot arm.We will need 3 to 4 power outlets to run the robot demo. There is an option to run the robot on Lithium Polymer batteries, but for safety related issues we prefer to use the power outlets instead of batteries for the demo.
