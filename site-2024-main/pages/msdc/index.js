          Our Middle School Design Competition (MSDC) is an engineering-focused competition on Friday, April 4. Students work in teams of 3-5 to create a design and presentation that will be evaluated at the end of the competition. Itâ€™s a great opportunity for students to gain hands-on engineering design and teamwork experience!

            We have decided not to release the themes this year to ensure a fair competition.
