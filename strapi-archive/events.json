With this knowledge we can avoid the risks that pollution brings to our rivers. The exhibit will take place in shores of the Boneyard Creek around the area of the Bardeen Quadrangle. The dye is non toxic and approval will be requested to University of Illinois, Division of Safety and Compliance. Observation areas will be marked to avoid tripping hazards.",

The robotic arm will be fixed and supported at the bottom on a base plate, and will have roughly six linkages to enable six degrees of freedom for accurate printing. At the end of the arm, there will be an extruder head that will use molten plastic (either filament or pellets) to print the desired CAD design onto the build plate. Credible motion planning algorithms will be used such that the arm has a constrained sphere of influence and does not harm the spectators in any way. The goal is to have spectators and participants select a CAD design and have the robotic arm print that design every 30 minutes during the exhibit times throughout the day. ",
