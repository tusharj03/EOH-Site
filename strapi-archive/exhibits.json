These patterned materials form the building blocks of everyday\nelectronics including LEDs, solar cells, computers, and cell phones. Because these\ndevices are at the micro or even the nanometer scale, they must be made in special\nenvironments called cleanrooms that control temperature, humidity, light, room pressure,\nand particles. Special clothing is also required to work in cleanrooms including hoods,\nsuits, boots, and gloves that protect these delicate structures from the particles we\ngenerate just by moving. We will have demonstrations of sun/UV light patterning on\npaper, posters showing microfabrication processing, and students working in the ECE 444\ncleanroom laboratory located on the second floor of HMNTL.",

        "VisGuide_Description": "\nThe Drug Discovery Game, titled \"Design Your Cure,\" is an engaging and educational activity that allows participants to experience how AI is revolutionizing drug development. The exhibit begins with an introduction to a specific \"disease\" and its biological cause, such as an overactive enzyme. Participants view an animated 3D representation of the target protein, the molecule that the drug needs to interact with, and learn about its structure and function. Using an intuitive interface on a large touchscreen or tablet, participants are tasked with designing a drug to block this enzyme and stop the disease. They can either select from pre-made drug templates or build their own molecule by dragging and combining chemical groups like benzene rings or hydroxyl groups.\n\nOnce the drug design is complete, participants test their creation by submitting it to the AI system. The AI evaluates key properties, such as the drug's binding affinity (how well it fits into the target protein\u2019s binding site), its predicted effectiveness in blocking the protein's activity, and potential issues like toxicity or poor solubility. Results are visually displayed, with feedback coded in green, yellow, or red to indicate the drug's performance. If the design is not optimal, participants receive suggestions from the AI, such as modifying the shape for better fit or reducing toxicity by removing certain chemical groups. They can iterate on their design and re-test it, observing how their changes improve the predicted outcome.\n\nAs participants refine their designs, they gain a \"drug designer score,\" which reflects the success of their final drug. A 3D viewer allows them to explore the molecular interactions between their drug and the protein in detail, with the AI highlighting critical features like hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic pockets. A leaderboard can add an element of competition, encouraging participants to achieve the best results.\n\nThe activity combines hands-on learning with real-time AI predictions, making complex concepts accessible and exciting. It demonstrates how AI accelerates drug discovery by predicting molecular interactions, balancing essential factors like efficacy and safety, and saving time and resources in the development of new treatments. Participants leave with a deeper understanding of the drug discovery process and the transformative role of AI in health science.",
